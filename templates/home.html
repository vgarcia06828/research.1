<h2> My Findings on <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/video_games/" target="_blank">Video Games!</a> </h2>
<br>
<h5> Questions about the data:</h5>
<br>
<p> What is a review score?</p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-danger" data-bs-toggle="popover" title="Review Score" data-bs-content="A review score is the average of all ratings published on the internet. It is to determine the quality of the item.">
    Response:
  </button>
<p> How were the video game lengths determined?</p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-warning" data-bs-toggle="popover" title="Video Game Length" data-bs-content="Video game lengths are determined by the number of people who play the game individually, and how long it takes for them to complete it. The lengths of the game are also determined by the makers of the game, because they decide what to add to the game themselves.">
    Response:
  </button>
<p> Did the dataset add the popularity of the game?</p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-success" data-bs-toggle="popover" title="Popularity" data-bs-content=" The dataset did not add the exact ratings of popularity the game had, but it did add its sales, which are measured under “Metrics” and “Sales.”">
    Response:
  </button>
<p> What if a video game has no end?</p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-bs-toggle="popover" title="Ending?" data-bs-content=" There are multiple video games that do not have specific ends. Most video games have end goals to complete the game, but some games like the Sims or MMOG have no limit to the play.">
    Response:
  </button>
<p> What if a video game does not have any speedruns?</p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-dark" data-bs-toggle="popover" title="Speedruns?" data-bs-content=" I don’t believe there are any games that do not have speedruns. According to Quora, a game has to have either no players or has to be so boring that it will not be wanted to speedrun. There is also another option, where a game can program itself to take exactly the same amount of time for each mission, therefore making it impossible to speedrun. ">
    Response:
  </button>
<p> How many more other video games were not mentioned in this dataset?</p>
<button type="button" class="btn btn-light" data-bs-toggle="popover" title="Missing Game Data" data-bs-content="I don't know if there is a way to determine which videogames were not included in the dataset. It is likely that over one hundred games were mentioned in the dataset, but I don't know if it is possible for me to look through all of the video games ever made and have them appear in the data set. ">
